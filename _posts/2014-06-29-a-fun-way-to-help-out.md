I'm a relatively new programmer and I frequently have questions about how things work.  When a series of well-crafted Google searches can't turn up the answer, I know exactly where to go.  I reach out to my brother-in-law.  He's one of those guys that's been programming since he was knee-high to a broomstick and now he's CTO of a tech startup.

While I'm sure he has more interesting coding problems to solve than mine, he's always got a few seconds to point me in the right direction.  Literally - a few seconds - because that's how long it takes him to diagnose issues I've been tracking down for hours.

Whether it's a family member, close friend, former professor or someone else, these kinds of relationships are invaluable.  Invaluable - if you're lucky enough to have them.  But what do learners in communities that don't have a history of being computer programmers do?  If you're the first person in your circle that's ever touched a piece of code, who do you ask when you're stuck?

That's one of the problems that schools like the Bronx Academy for Software Engineering (BASE) are trying solve by reaching out to community volunteers.

Last Saturday, I had the opportunity to work with a group of students from BASE that were coming to a weekend course put on by The Flatiron School.  It was taught by Victoria Freedman - Flatiron's Lead Instructor for their high school program.   She walked them through basic commands on the command line, introduced them to version control with git and GitHub and had them code their own basic calculator program in Ruby.

While she was teaching, my job was to answer side questions and help keep everyone caught up.  During the 5 hours I spent there, I:

+ reinstalled a bash profile so it matched the standard one used in the examples
+ helped multiple kids figure out how to get set up with GitHub accounts
+ walked through the git code for cloning repos (multiple times - this one seems to be a tough one for beginners)
+ helped debug some Ruby code
+ ate a free sammich!
+ hung out with some amazing kids that are passionate about coding

Not bad for someone that hadn't touched the command line and certainly hadn't used any git until about 3 weeks earlier.  I had a blast and I was able to solidify some concepts in my own mind by explaining them to other people.  I also laughed every time I heard myself echoing the instructors at Flatiron, "Lines of code are free.  Just practice coding.  GitHub repositories don't cost anything.  Practice making them until you understand it."  I may or may not have (figuratively) rolled my eyes when they said it to me two weeks earlier, but it had still worked its way into my brain and now I was passing that great advice along.

Which brings me to my point - if you've got one solid week of experience, you can be the person that helps out the guy that has questions on day one.  If you've got a year (or more) under your belt, even better!  There are plenty of people that could use mentoring in software development and many of them can only get that mentoring through volunteer programs.

If you would like to volunteer to help out at BASE, [go here](http://www.imentor.org/become-a-mentor) and complete the application (being sure to mention BASE in the application).  If you're not Bronx-adjacent, don't worry, there will be plenty of opportunities to volunteer in your area - just spend a bit of time searching and you'll find a program that will be a good fit for you.
